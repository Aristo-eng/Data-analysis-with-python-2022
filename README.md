- ✨ Exercises and solutions  ✨

## Week One

 Basics of python, different data structures that can be used to store data. Implement different methods used to manipulate these data structures and examine their efficiency. Understand the advantages and applications of different data structures. Learn how to
 approach open ended problems and select appropriate data structures based on requirements.

### Python Fundementals 

- Flow control
- Loops
- Functions
- Data types and variables
- Manipulation & usage and operators

### Basic DS
- Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
- Linked lists (linked list types & operations)
- Queues (queues operations & queues types)
- Hash table

## Week Two

 Learn and implement basic algorithms such as searching and sorting on different data structures and examine the efficiency of these algorithms. Use recursion to implement these algorithms. Learn advanced data structures such as trees and graphs, implement different methods used to manipulate these data structures, examine their efficiency. Learn how to approach open ended problems and select which data structure to use based on requirements

 ## Week Three

 Go into recursivity in python. Implemented a factorial solution using recursivity. 

  ## Week Four

  - format printing
  - decision making (if)
  - repetitive tasks (loops)
  - functions
   - argument packing and unpacking
   - named argument in function
   - sum of sqaures passing list
   - sum of sqaures passing arbitrary argument
  
  

 ## Exercises

 Added solution for different exercises in Python 

### Exercise 1 (hello world)

Fill in the missing piece in the solution stub file hello_world.py in folder src to make it print the following:

Hello, world!

Make sure you use correct indenting. You can run it with command python3 src/hello_world.py. 

### Exercise 2 (compliment)

Fill in the stub solution to make the program work as follows. The program should ask the user for an input, and the print an answer as the examples below show.

What country are you from? Sweden
I have heard that Sweden is a beautiful country.

What country are you from? Chile  
I have heard that Chile is a beautiful country.


### Exercise 3 (multiplication)

Make a program that gives the following output. You should use a for loop in your solution.

4 multiplied by 0 is 0
4 multiplied by 1 is 4
4 multiplied by 2 is 8
4 multiplied by 3 is 12
4 multiplied by 4 is 16
4 multiplied by 5 is 20
4 multiplied by 6 is 24
4 multiplied by 7 is 28
4 multiplied by 8 is 32
4 multiplied by 9 is 36
4 multiplied by 10 is 40


### Exercise 4 (multiplication table)

In the main function print a multiplication table, which is shown below:

   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8   9  10
   2   4   6   8  10  12  14  16  18  20
   3   6   9  12  15  18  21  24  27  30
   4   8  12  16  20  24  28  32  36  40
   5  10  15  20  25  30  35  40  45  50
   6  12  18  24  30  36  42  48  54  60
   7  14  21  28  35  42  49  56  63  70
   8  16  24  32  40  48  56  64  72  80
   9  18  27  36  45  54  63  72  81  90
  10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90 100

For example at row 4 and column 9 we have 4*9=36.

Use two nested for loops to achive this. Note that you can use the following form to stop the print function from automatically starting a new line:

print("text", end="")
print("more text")

textmore text

Print the numbers in a field with width four, so that the numbers are nicely aligned. 


### Exercise 5 (two dice)

Let us consider throwing two dice. (A dice can give a value between 1 and 6.) Use two nested for loops in the main function to iterate through all possible combinations the pair of dice can give. There are 36 possible combinations. Print all those combinations as (ordered) pairs that sum to 5. For example, your printout should include the pair (2,3). Print one pair per line.
