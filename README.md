## Week One

 Basics of python, different data structures that can be used to store data. Implement different methods used to manipulate these data structures and examine their efficiency. Understand the advantages and applications of different data structures. Learn how to
 approach open ended problems and select appropriate data structures based on requirements.

### Python Fundementals 

- Flow control
- Loops
- Functions
- Data types and variables
- Manipulation & usage and operators

### Basic DS
- Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
- Linked lists (linked list types & operations)
- Queues (queues operations & queues types)
- Hash table

## Week Two

 Learn and implement basic algorithms such as searching and sorting on different data structures and examine the efficiency of these algorithms. Use recursion to implement these algorithms. Learn advanced data structures such as trees and graphs, implement different methods used to manipulate these data structures, examine their efficiency. Learn how to approach open ended problems and select which data structure to use based on requirements

 ## Week Three

 Go into recursivity in python. Implemented a factorial solution using recursivity. 

 ## Exercises

 Added solution for different exercises in Python
