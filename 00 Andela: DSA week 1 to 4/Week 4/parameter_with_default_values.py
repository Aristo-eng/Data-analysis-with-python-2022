With the default parameter this is the Euclidean distance, and if pâ‰ 2 it is called p-norm.

We saw that it was possible to use packing and unpacking of arguments with the notation, when one wants

to specify arbitrary number of positional arguments*. This is also possible for arbitrary number of named

arguments with the ** notation. We will talk about this more in the data structures section.
